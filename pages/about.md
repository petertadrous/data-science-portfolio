# **Interests**

In my free time, I enjoy camping, hiking, reading, and traveling to new places. I am always eager to learn new things, and I appreciate a good laugh, especially in the realm of comedy. I love spending time with my cat and playing the ukulele. My passion for technology extends beyond my professional life, as I enjoy exploring new technologies, experimenting with Docker, and finding innovative ways to apply my skills.
