# Simulating Various Asset Allocation Strategies


### Project Overview

Monte Carlo and Historical simulations of various asset allocation strategies in retirement funds. This module models:

* Growth of contributions over time (Roth/Traditional)
* Performance of various asset allocation strategies and glide paths using both monte carlo simulations and historical data
* Impact of Federal and NYS tax
* Withdrawals, SSI, RMDs, and more
